changed schema in Essay.js - renamed to heuristicSchema (using your existing dummy Schema)
	- exported name is kept the same

changed essays.js controller - unified resultDict from both objective and subjective heuristics
instead of keeping two separate dictionaries.
	- also added functionality to calculate normals
	- 

changed process.js - objective and subjective heuristics should be usable (subjective might not work yet..)
